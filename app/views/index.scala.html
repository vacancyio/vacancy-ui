            <p>Traditional recruitment is a frustrating process filled with misinformation and hard to find data.
                As software developers we deserve something better. Vacancy collects high quality programming
                jobs (remote, contract, freelance and full time) from around the web and organizes them in one, easily searchable place.</p>
            <p>We even provide a simple JSON API for you to integrate into your own apps.</p>

            <p>It's free to start engaging with software engineers and programmers looking for new opportunities.</p>
