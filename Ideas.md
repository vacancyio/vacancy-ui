            <p>Vacancy is a recruitment site build by software engineers for jobs related to programming, start ups and tech.
               We started this site because we wanted to answer a simple question that no other site could answer:
              <blockquote>"What programming opportunities are available right now?"</blockquote>
            <p>
                Our intuitive recruitment platform notifies you when jobs come up matching your interests (JavaScript contracts in London for example).
            </p>
            <h2>For employers</h2>
            <p>Finding software developers is hard. We try and make it easy for you by giving you a powerful tool for posting jobs and tracking
               interested candidates. We cut out the middle men. No recruiters. Speak directly to talented developers interested in working for you.</p>
